CVPPA aims to advance computer vision for plant and crop applications. Plant phenotyping is the identification of effects on plant structure and function (the phenotype) resulting from genotypic differences (i.e., differences in the genetic code) and the environmental conditions to which a plant has been exposed. Knowledge of plant phenotypes is a key ingredient of the knowledge-based bioeconomy, which not only literally helps to feed the world, but is also essential for feed, fibre and fuel production.

Computer vision in agriculture problems tend to revolve around automation problems, such as automated detection of plant organs for automated weeding or harvest. The images are acquired in a variety of contexts: forests, fields, greenhouses or controlled environments, packing houses, etc.

We want to identify key but unsolved problems, expose the current state-of-the-art, and broaden the field and the community.

Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

* advances in segmentation, tracking, detection, reconstruction and identification methods that address unsolved plant phenotyping and agricultural scenarios;
* open source implementations, comparison and discussion of existing methods and annotation tools;
* image data sets defining plant phenotyping or agricultural tasks, complete with annotations if appropriate, accompanied with benchmark methods if possible, and suitable evaluation methods; and
* challenge contributions - [click here for more information regarding the challenges](/challenges/)

[Submission will be done on CMT.](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CVPPA2025)

## Papers and extended abstracts

Accepted full papers will be included in the ICCV Workshop Proceedings. Accepted extended abstracts will published on this website.


## Author Information

Authors should comply with ICCV 2025 [submission guidelines](https://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/AuthorGuidelines) to format their full paper, extended abstract, or challenge technical report. Submission are handled via [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CVPPA2025). The peer-review process is double blind, as usual, in order to ensure unbiased reviews and highest paper quality.

Paper registration is performed by registering as a user with [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CVPPA2025) and entering a paper title and abstract. This will result in the allocation of a `paper ID`, which indicates registration is completed and should be used in preparation of the review copy. You will be able to make edits and upload new paper drafts until the final deadline. Submitted papers should be prepared according to the published specification for formatting and style. Please be sure to read both the formatting instructions and policies before submission. Please refer to [ICCV 2025 FAQ](https://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/AuthorGuidelines#AuthorFAQs) for common questions.

## Submission Guidelines

Full papers, extended abstracts, and challenges technical reports should be submitted using the template for ECCV 2024. Papers submitted for review must be anonymous in order to enable double-blind review, and instead include the `paper ID` as allocated by CMT upon registration of the paper. The addition of line numbers (automatic in the LaTeX template) should be included, in order to facilitate the review process.

### Full Papers
Full paper submissions must be **longer than 4 pages and up to 8 pages**, including figures and tables, but not including references. Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed. Please download the [ICCV 2025 Author Kit](https://media.eventhosts.cc/Conferences/ICCV2025/ICCV2025-Author-Kit-Feb.zip) for detailed formatting instructions.

### Supplementary Materials

Authors may optionally upload supplementary material, which may include:

* Videos to showcase results/demo of the proposed approach/system,
* Images and other results in addition to the ones in the paper,
* Anonymised related submissions to other conferences and journals,
* Appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential to the understanding of the submitted paper.

### Extended Abstracts

The length s**hould not exceed 2 pages** excluding the references. Extended abstracts will appear (after peer review) on the CVPPA website, but will not be part of ICCVW 2025 proceedings. The same double blind rules apply (see above). As a guide, extended abstracts should follow a regular paper structure, though abbreviated. This should include an introduction, a description of the work undertaken, the results, and a conclusion.

## Submission Policies

We will follow the [ICCV 2025 submission policies](https://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025/AuthorGuidelines). By submitting a manuscript to CVPPA 2025, the authors guarantee that it has not been previously published (or accepted for publication) in substantially similar form. Furthermore, no full paper which contains significant overlap with the contributions of this paper is either under review at the moment of submission or will be submitted during the CVPPA 2025 review period to any of the following: another conference, a workshop, or a journal. The authors also attest that they did not submit substantially similar submissions to CVPPA 2025. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection.

### Responsibilities

If there are papers that may appear to violate any of these conditions, it is the authorsâ€™ responsibility to cite these papers (preserving anonymity), argue in the body of your paper why your CVPPA 2025 paper is nontrivially different from these concurrent submissions, include anonymized versions of those papers in the supplemental material.

### Camera Ready Copy

Camera-ready submission for accepted papers will be submitted on [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CVPPA2025). A transfer of copyright to IEEE will be required for camera-ready submission. Each published paper must have at least one author registered for the workshop under an AUTHOR registration (virtual Registrations will not cover paper submissions). Papers for which we have no registered authors will be removed from the workshop.

For each accepted full paper authors should upload:
* final camera-ready paper (in PDF format),
* optional supplementary materials (single ZIP file up to 100MB).

The name of your submission file must be of the form `XXXX.pdf` where `XXXX` is the four-digit paper ID (zero-padded if necessary). For example, if your paper ID is 47, the filename must be `0047.pdf`.
