This workshop will showcase the challenges raised by working on computer vision for plant phenotyping and agriculture. Workshop goals include demonstrating the state-of-the-art, identifying key unsolved problems, and introducing computer scientists with an interest in plant phenotyping to the field. Effective plant phenotyping is urgently needed to support the sustainability of our planet and its inhabitants: having strong community structures and computer vision scientists enter this field is more crucial now than ever.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the [International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025](https://iccv.thecvf.com/Conferences/2025). Day and location will be communicated closer to the day of the main confernece.

We recommend to register to the conference timely to avoid delays.

This yearâ€™s featured Challenge is the **Global Wheat Full SemSeg Competition**, and *two* travel awards are available for attending CVPPA, for more details see [Challenge page](/challenge/).
